                        Food loss and waste have become an issue of great public
                        concern. Between one-third and one-half of all produced
                        food is wasted, lost or left uneaten. This practise is
                        not only morally irresponsible, but it is also
                        unsustainable from a world resource and environmental
                        perspective. We all have a part to plat in reducing food
                        loss and waste, not only for the sake of the food but
                        for the resources that go into it.

                        We have created an app that focuses on
                        reducing food waste in homes around the world. Even
                        though this problem spans over multiple areas, from
                        production to personal consumption, we believe that
                        combatting this problem should start at home. To help
                        solve this problem we have created an app called
                        Optimat. We hope that bringing awareness to the problem
                        will lead to less overall food loss and waste.

                        We have created an app that helps you keep track of
                        groceries that you buy. The app lets you scan groceries.
                        Scanning the groceries adds then to an inventory, here
                        products and expiry dates are displayed. The app will
                        also display viable recipes based on which groceries you
                        have stored in your home. It also lets you create a
                        schedule so that you can plan what meals you are going
                        to have, ahead of time.
