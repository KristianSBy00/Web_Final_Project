                        Producing food costs resources. These resources include
                        land, water, energy, soil, seeds and other inputs. When
                        we produce food that never gets eaten, these resources
                        are wasted. The waste of these recourses increases the
                        greenhouse gas in vain. The reduction in food waste
                        would also help us achieve the UN sustainability goal of
                        zero hunger.

                        The problem of food loss lies in all stages of “the life
                        cycle of food”. These include production, processing,
                        retailing and consumption. In low-income countries, most
                        of the food is wasted during the production stage. In
                        higher income countries a lot of the food is wasted at
                        the consumption stage. The possible reason for this is
                        that higher income countries take food for granted, and
                        they have generally lower respect for food.
